estimating_surface_normals
==========================
   A complete version of estimating surface normals on PCL tutorial: http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/normal_estimation.php#normal-estimation
   
   You can download any PCD files, and remember to change the PCD files names in the estimating_normals.cpp
   
   
        I added the read files and viewers functions.

         Hopefully it will help if you'd like to try:) 
   Installation and compilation:
   $ git clone
